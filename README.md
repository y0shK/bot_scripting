# bot_scripting
bits and pieces of lua scripting for FCEUX/VBA/Bizhawk as well as Python scripting for PyBoy, to create bots and CPUs

This repository contains all of the Lua scripts I've worked with for emulators like FCEUX and BizHawk. 
--The Super Mario Bros. bot controls Mario through 1-1 of Super Mario Bros.
--The Super Mario World bot analyzes how well the computer performs by checking changes in Mario's variables (like lives and coins).
