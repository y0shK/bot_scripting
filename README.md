# bot_scripting
This repository contains several bits and pieces of lua scripting for FCEUX/VBA/Bizhawk, as well as Python scripting for PyBoy. THe aim of these scripts is to create bots and CPUs to automate video games.

All of the Lua scripts I've worked with for emulators like FCEUX and BizHawk are hereafter indicated. 
The Super Mario Bros. bot controls Mario through 1-1 of Super Mario Bros.
The Super Mario World bot analyzes how well the computer performs by checking changes in Mario's variables (like lives and coins).
